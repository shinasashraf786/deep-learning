    "Importing subprocess:\n",
    "subprocess is a Python module that allows you to spawn new processes, connect to their input/output/error pipes, and obtain their return codes. \n",

    "\n",

    "Purpose: Converts text to speech using the macOS say command.\n",
    "Parameters: text (string) - The text that will be converted to speech.\n",
    "Process:\n",
    "subprocess.run(['say', text], check=True): This line executes the say command with the specified text. The check=True parameter ensures that if the command fails (returns a non-zero exit code), a subprocess.CalledProcessError exception is raised.\n",
    "If the command executes successfully, the message \"Speech synthesis complete.\" is printed.\n",

    "text_to_speech(text): Calls the text_to_speech function with the defined text.\n",
    "How it Works:\n",
    "The script uses the macOS say command to convert the given text (\"eni ennum happy aayirikum\") to speech.\n",
    "The subprocess.run(['say', text], check=True) line executes the command in the shell.\n",
    "If successful, it prints \"Speech synthesis complete.\".\n",
    "If an error occurs during execution (such as the say command not being available), it catches the error and prints the specific error message.\n",
    "Notes:\n",
    "This script is specific to macOS due to its reliance on the say command.\n",
    "If you want to make a similar script cross-platform (for Windows and Linux), you would need to use different commands or libraries specific to those platforms.\n",
    "Always ensure that the necessary commands or libraries are installed and accessible on the target system where the script will be run.\n",
    "This approach is straightforward for macOS users who want a quick way to convert text to speech using the built-in say command-line tool.\n",
